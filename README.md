# VRKG-CollaborativeExploration
A Virtual Reality multi-user application for Meta Quest Pro to collaboratively import, discuss and interact with a fully 3D representation of a Knowledge Graph

The project is divided in two parts: 
* UnityProject: The VR Application that imports and visualizes the knowledge graphs
* WebApp: The source code of the web application that allow users to populate the public repository with SPARQL query results, that can then be imported by the Virtual Reality Application
